	abstract = {Molten salt reactors have seen a marked resurgence of interest over the past decade, highlighted by their inclusion as one of six Generation IV reactor types. The most active development period however was between the mid 1950s and early 1970s at Oak Ridge National Laboratories (ORNL) and any new re-examination of this concept must bear in mind the far different priorities then in place. High breeding ratios and short doubling times were paramount and this guided the evolution of the Molten Salt Breeder Reactor (MSBR) program. As the inherent advantages of the molten salt concept have become apparent to an increasing number of researchers worldwide it is important to not simply look to continue where ORNL left off but to return to basics in order to offer the best design using updated goals and abilities. A major potential change to the traditional Single Fluid, MSBR design and a subject of this presentation is a return to the mode of operation that ORNL proposed for the majority of its MSR program. That being the Two Fluid design in which separate salts are used for fissile 233UF4 and fertile ThF4. Oak Ridge abandoned this promising route due to what was known as the “plumbing problem”. It will be shown that a simple yet crucial modification to core geometry can solve this problem and enable the many advantages of the Two Fluid design. In addition, another very promising route laid out by ORNL was simplified Single Fluid converter reactors that could obtain far superior lifetime uranium utilization than LWR or CANDU without the need for any fuel processing beyond simple chemistry control. Updates and potential improvements to this very attractive concept will also be explored.},

MSR achieves more than twice the fuel utilization of light water reactors (LWRs). When using 5\% enriched uranium
– the maximum enrichment readily available in the current supply chain – this increased efficiency leads to an
approximate 53\% waste reduction compared to LWRs. Using higher enrichments, up to the 20\% Low Enriched

The fluid fuel in these reactors, consisting of UF4 and ThF4 dissolved in fluorides of beryllium and lithium, is circulated through a reactor core moderated by graphite. Technology developments over the past 20 years have culminated in the successful operation of the 8-MW(th) MoltenSalt Reactor Experiment (MSRE), and have indicated that operation with a molten fuel is practical, that the salt is stable under reactor conditions, and that corrosion is very low. Processing of the MSRE fuel has demonstrated the MSR processing associated with high-performance converters. New fuel processing methods under development should permit MSR’s to operate as economical breeders. These features, combined with high thermal efficiency (44\%) and low primary system pressure, give MSR converters and breeders potentially favorable economic, fuel utilization, and safety characteristics. Further, these reactors can be initially fueled with 233U, 235U, or plutonium. The construction cost of an MSBR power plant is estimated to be about the same as that of light-water reactors. This could lend to power costs 0.5 to 1.0 mill/kWh less than those for light-water reactors. Achievement of economic molten-salt breeder reactors requires the construction and operation of several reactors of increasing size and their associated processing plants.},

	abstract = {Current interest in advanced nuclear energy and MSR concepts has enhanced demand in building the tools to analyze these systems. This thesis introduces a Python script, SaltProc, which simulates MSR online reprocessing by modeling the changing isotopic composition of an irradiated fuel salt. SaltProc couples with the Monte Carlo code, SERPENT 2, for neutron transport and depletion calculations. SaltProc capabilities include a generic geometry capable of modeling multi-region and multi-flow systems, time-dependent feeds and removals, and specific separation efficiency for each element or isotope removal flow. Generally applicable capabilities are illuminated in this thesis in three applied problems: (1) simulating the startup of a thorium-fueled MSBR fuel cycle to find equilibrium fuel composition (when multiplication factor of the full-core model and the U-233 concentration in the fuel salt are invariant in time); (2) determining the effect of the fuel salt irradiation with online reprocessing on MSBR operations; and (3) estimating MSBR fuel cycle performance by computing the Th-232 feed rate over 20 years of operation and comparing with available data. In the first application, full-core depletion in the MSBR demonstrated that (1) equilibrium fuel composition could be achieved after 16 years and (2) the multiplication factor stabilizes after 6 years of operation. In the second application, fuel salt irradiation with simulated fission product removal and fissile/fertile feed causes considerable neutron energy spectrum hardening; this spectral shift has a problematic impact on safety parameters (e.g., temperature reactivity feedback, reactivity control system worth). In the third application, the average Th-232 feed rate throughout 20 years of operation is 2.39 kg/day or 100 g/GWh(e) which is a good agreement with other recent research. Problematic effects of neutron energy spectrum hardening during MSBR operation should be taken into account for neutronics, multi-physics, and fuel cycle performance analysis.},

To further develop these MSR concepts, researchers need simulation tools for analyzing liquid-fueled MSR depletion and fuel processing. However, most contemporary nuclear reactor physics software is unable to perform high-fidelity full-core depletion calculations for a reactor design with online reprocessing. This paper introduces a Python package, SaltProc, which couples with the Monte Carlo code, SERPENT2 to simulate MSR online reprocessing by modeling the changing isotopic composition of MSR fuel salt. This work demonstrates SaltProc capabilities for a full-core, high-fidelity model of the commercial Molten Salt Breeder Reactor (MSBR) concept and verifies these results to results in the literature from independent, lower-fidelity analyses.},

	abstract = {This paper analyses the economic factors that drive nuclear power load-following in future European electricity systems. A power plant dispatching model is built to simulate deregulated markets, in order to identify to what extent additional flexibility is needed from nuclear power due to more renewables. We contribute to the literature with an economic perspective of the nuclear load-following by means of numerical simulations of several European power systems that will pursue the nuclear policy in 2050. Results show that intermittency would make flexible nuclear reactors cycling more often and retire earlier. The highest requirements for flexibility would be in systems with high shares of nuclear, renewables or coal-fired plants (Central-Western Europe and certain Central-Eastern European countries) and in systems with low grid interconnections (Western Europe and South-West). Load-following implies lower capacity factors for nuclear plants, except for Central-Western Europe where operating flexibly would allow reactors to supply more output than in steady-state mode. The lowest generation cost is found in Nordic countries where most of the flexibility is provided by hydro-units, and hence nuclear power plants operate mostly baseload. Ensuring flexibility becomes financially interesting when nuclear power plants are not the marginal technology setting the clearing price; in this way the infra-marginal rent allows operators to capture high revenues. It is shown that nuclear flexibility is profitable from a broader social welfare perspective, such as safe baseload units' operation, renewables' integration, system operators' balancing, and consumer's price.},

	abstract = {The University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign (UIUC) is engaged in work to develop a fuel processing system that enables load-following in Molten Salt Reactors (MSRs), an important ability that allows nuclear power plants to ramp electricity production up or down to meet changing electricity demand. Nuclear reactions in MSRs produce unwanted byproducts (such as xenon and krypton) that can adversely affect power production. In steady, baseload operation, these byproducts form and decay at the same rate. When electricity production is ramped down, however, the byproducts start to be produced at a greater rate than they decay, leading to a buildup within the reactor. When power production must be once again increased, the response rate is slowed by the time needed for the byproducts to reach their equilibrium level (determined by the radioactive decay half-life, which is on the order of hours). Thus, buildup of these unwanted byproducts resulting from ramping down inhibit proper load following for molten salt reactors. Fortunately, MSRs transport fuel in a flowing molten salt fuel loop, which means that a section of the reactor, outside the core, can be leveraged for fuel processing and "cleanup." The team will determine the feasibility of removal of these unwanted byproducts and de- sign a fuel reprocessing system, removing a major barrier to commercialization for molten salt reactors.

Toward this work, we initiated the Fuel Cycle Simulation task (Task 2) in August 2018 to more realistically model the online reprocessing system of the Transatomic Power (TAP) MSR. A Python toolkit, SaltProc v0.1 [1–3], was developed to represent the simplified online fuel salt processing of a Molten Salt Breeder Reactor (MSBR). More recently, an advanced SaltProc version (SaltProc v0.2) was developed to generically simulate complex molten salt fuel reprocessing systems, including the TAP system, incorporating user-parametrized components into the fuel salt processing design. This report summarizes the progress we have made towards milestone M2.1: Demonstrate SaltProc and the steps toward the subsequent Task 2 objectives.},

	abstract = {The Generation-IV consortium seeks to develop a new generation of nuclear energy systems for commercial deployment by 2020–2030. These systems include both the reactors and their fuel-cycle facilities. The aim is to provide significant improvements in economics, safety, sustainability, and proliferation resistance. The systems selected for development are the very high-temperature gas-cooled reactor (VHTR), the sodium-cooled fast reactor (SFR), the gas-cooled fast reactor (GFR), the lead-cooled fast reactor (LFR), the molten salt reactor (MSR) and the super-critical water-cooled reactor (SCWR). UK organisations plan to contribute to the first three of these systems because of its existing capabilities and experience with gas-cooled systems, graphite cores, and SFRs. The science base for the VHTR and SFR systems is reasonably established, although there are gaps. For the VHTR, these include the performance of graphite at high neutron doses, and the performance of the fuel. For the SFR, the behaviour of fuels containing minor actinides, and processes for their recycling and refabrication into new fuel, must be established. The GFR presents many technical challenges, because it would need fuel and structural materials capable of withstanding extremes of fast neutron flux and high temperatures. Adequate heat removal from the core under fault conditions is likely to determine its feasibility.},
