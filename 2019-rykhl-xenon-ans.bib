	abstract = {Molten salt reactors have seen a marked resurgence of interest over the past decade, highlighted by their inclusion as one of six Generation IV reactor types. The most active development period however was between the mid 1950s and early 1970s at Oak Ridge National Laboratories (ORNL) and any new re-examination of this concept must bear in mind the far different priorities then in place. High breeding ratios and short doubling times were paramount and this guided the evolution of the Molten Salt Breeder Reactor (MSBR) program. As the inherent advantages of the molten salt concept have become apparent to an increasing number of researchers worldwide it is important to not simply look to continue where ORNL left off but to return to basics in order to offer the best design using updated goals and abilities. A major potential change to the traditional Single Fluid, MSBR design and a subject of this presentation is a return to the mode of operation that ORNL proposed for the majority of its MSR program. That being the Two Fluid design in which separate salts are used for fissile 233UF4 and fertile ThF4. Oak Ridge abandoned this promising route due to what was known as the “plumbing problem”. It will be shown that a simple yet crucial modification to core geometry can solve this problem and enable the many advantages of the Two Fluid design. In addition, another very promising route laid out by ORNL was simplified Single Fluid converter reactors that could obtain far superior lifetime uranium utilization than LWR or CANDU without the need for any fuel processing beyond simple chemistry control. Updates and potential improvements to this very attractive concept will also be explored.},

	shorttitle = {Advanced online fuel reprocessing simulation for thorium-fueled molten salt breeder reactor},
	abstract = {Current interest in advanced nuclear energy and MSR concepts has enhanced demand in building the tools to analyze these systems. This thesis introduces a Python script, SaltProc, which simulates MSR online reprocessing by modeling the changing isotopic composition of an irradiated fuel salt. SaltProc couples with the Monte Carlo code, SERPENT 2, for neutron transport and depletion calculations. SaltProc capabilities include a generic geometry capable of modeling multi-region and multi-flow systems, time-dependent feeds and removals, and specific separation efficiency for each element or isotope removal flow. Generally applicable capabilities are illuminated in this thesis in three applied problems: (1) simulating the startup of a thorium-fueled MSBR fuel cycle to find equilibrium fuel composition (when multiplication factor of the full-core model and the U-233 concentration in the fuel salt are invariant in time); (2) determining the effect of the fuel salt irradiation with online reprocessing on MSBR operations; and (3) estimating MSBR fuel cycle performance by computing the Th-232 feed rate over 20 years of operation and comparing with available data. In the first application, full-core depletion in the MSBR demonstrated that (1) equilibrium fuel composition could be achieved after 16 years and (2) the multiplication factor stabilizes after 6 years of operation. In the second application, fuel salt irradiation with simulated fission product removal and fissile/fertile feed causes considerable neutron energy spectrum hardening; this spectral shift has a problematic impact on safety parameters (e.g., temperature reactivity feedback, reactivity control system worth). In the third application, the average Th-232 feed rate throughout 20 years of operation is 2.39 kg/day or 100 g/GWh(e) which is a good agreement with other recent research. Problematic effects of neutron energy spectrum hardening during MSBR operation should be taken into account for neutronics, multi-physics, and fuel cycle performance analysis.},

	abstract = {This paper analyses the economic factors that drive nuclear power load-following in future European electricity systems. A power plant dispatching model is built to simulate deregulated markets, in order to identify to what extent additional flexibility is needed from nuclear power due to more renewables. We contribute to the literature with an economic perspective of the nuclear load-following by means of numerical simulations of several European power systems that will pursue the nuclear policy in 2050. Results show that intermittency would make flexible nuclear reactors cycling more often and retire earlier. The highest requirements for flexibility would be in systems with high shares of nuclear, renewables or coal-fired plants (Central-Western Europe and certain Central-Eastern European countries) and in systems with low grid interconnections (Western Europe and South-West). Load-following implies lower capacity factors for nuclear plants, except for Central-Western Europe where operating flexibly would allow reactors to supply more output than in steady-state mode. The lowest generation cost is found in Nordic countries where most of the flexibility is provided by hydro-units, and hence nuclear power plants operate mostly baseload. Ensuring flexibility becomes financially interesting when nuclear power plants are not the marginal technology setting the clearing price; in this way the infra-marginal rent allows operators to capture high revenues. It is shown that nuclear flexibility is profitable from a broader social welfare perspective, such as safe baseload units' operation, renewables' integration, system operators' balancing, and consumer's price.},
